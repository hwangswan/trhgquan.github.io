Currently I'm a Knowledge Engineering BS-MS student at [The VNUHCM - University of Science](https://en.hcmus.edu.vn), batch of 2019, majoring in **Natural Language Processing** and working on my graduation thesis from August 2022 (see below). 

I'm planned to graduate and receive my BSc. degree in 2023, then continue pursuing my MSc. in Computer Science, still focusing on **Natural Language Processing**.

Feel free to send me an email: *quan* (at) *trhgquan* (dot) *xyz*

## Research Interests
My research topics in Natural Language Processing include:
- **Optical Character Recognition.**
  - Build an OCR system for Vietnamese Ancient Text (Chu Nom), using CenterNet for segmentation and simple character classification for recognition. Here's the [GitHub repository for my work](https://github.com/trhgquan/OCR_chu_Nom) in Spring 2022.
- **Text Classification.**
- **Semantic Textual Similarity.**
- **Text Correction & Suggestion.**
  - [Address Correction based on Machine Learning - BSc. Graduation thesis](/address-correction-with-ml), 2023

Beside Natural Language Processing, I have some interests in:
- **Cryptography**: currently I'm maintaining a repository (in Vietnamese) for Introduction to Cryptography (CSC15005) and Applied Cryptography (CSC15003) course materials (code, course summarise). Checkout the repository [here](https://github.com/trhgquan/crypto). Also, there is an online version [here](https://trhgquan.github.io/crypto).
- **Mathematics**: Mathematical Analysis, Number Theory and Abstract Algebra.

## Tech
- **Coding**: C/C++, Python (Flask, Django), PHP (Laravel), JavaScript (vanilla), Perl.
- **Scripting**: Bash, AutoIt, Makefile.
- **ML/DL**: TensorFlow, trax, scikit-learn.
- **Misc**: Markdown, LaTeX  and vanilla vim (my configurations are [here](https://github.com/hwangswan/dotfiles)).
