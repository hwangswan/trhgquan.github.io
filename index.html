        Sometimes you might found me sneaking around GitHub as a contributor.<br/>
        In fact I wasted a lot of times into GitHub, mostly in private repositories<br/> 
        and did some "research" in GitHub Actions.

        The point is I can't share most of my products since they are involving some active games.

        This page is sooo boring? Correct! The owner of this page is the same, too.
